== PROJECT: One Life

---

=== Overview

One Life is a desktop medical management application used for storing and displaying data related to patients and doctors.
The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

=== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to schedule and display medical appointments*
** What it does: allows the user to schedule appointments at a specified time.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to display current appointments and schedule appointments.
This is a key part of medical operations in a hospital.
Further checks are available to inform the user if they keyed in incorrect appointment details.
** Highlights: This enhancement drastically improved the ability of the application to assist medical processes, specifically in the area of scheduling appointment.
The implementation too was challenging as it required a brand new command to be created.
