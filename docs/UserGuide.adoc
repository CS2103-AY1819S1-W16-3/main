== Introduction

OneLife (OL) is designed for service providers in the healthcare industry who *prefer to use a desktop application for
managing patient and doctor information*. More importantly, OneLife is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you prefer typing, OneLife can get your medical information management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
Listed below are instructions to help you get started:

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file into the folder you want to use as the home folder for OneLife.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI (as shown in Figure 1 below) should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
E.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. +
Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts.
* **`add`**`r/patient n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 ic/S9601234A` : adds a patient named `John Doe` to the database.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the database. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [ic/NRIC] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list.
The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +

// tag::find[]
=== Locating person by any attribute: `find`

Finds people with the keywords specified by the user within specific fields
(i.e. `Name`, `Phone`, `Address`, `Tag` etc). +
Format: `find [PREFIX] KEYWORDS [NEXT_PREFIX] [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

[NOTE]
If no `Prefix` is given, the search will be performed on all attributes. This means that the user can perform both
a global search and a specific search by entering keywords directly after `find` but before the first `Prefix`.

****
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `nelvin` will match `Nelvin`.
* When performing a global search, keywords are seperated by whitespace and any `Person` whose attributes contain any
keyword will be returned. e.g. `find kang ken` will display `Kang Tze`, `Kenneth` and all `Person` with `Address` `Choa Chu Kang`.
* When performing specific search, `Person` must contain the searched keywords exactly in order to be displayed.
e.g `find n/Gary Goh` will display `Gary Goh Yipeng` but not `Kenneth Goh Jun Teck`.
* When performing the `find` command with more than one search field, all `Person` matching at least one search field
will be displayed. e.g. `find n/Gary a/Kang` will display `Gary Goh Yipeng` and all `Person` whose `Address` is
`Choa Chu Kang`.
****

[WARNING]
Search keywords must be entered behind a `Prefix` whenever a `Prefix` is used in the input. A command like `find n/[BLANK]` is not a valid input.

Examples:

* `find t/friends` +
Displays all `Person` with `Tag`: `friends`.
* `find t/friends r/doctor` +
Displays all `Person` whom have a `Tag` labelled `friends` and whose `Role` is `Doctor`.
* The images below illustrate the above-mentioned examples.
