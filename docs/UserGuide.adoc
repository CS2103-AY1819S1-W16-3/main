== Introduction

One Life (OL) is for service providers in the healthcare industry who *prefer to use a desktop application for managing patient and doctor information*. More importantly, One Life is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you prefer typing, One Life can get your medical information management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for One Life.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`r/patient n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 ic/S9601234A` : adds a patient named `John Doe` to the database.
